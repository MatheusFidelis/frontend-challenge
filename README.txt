Hello guys! The master branch has the folders to open correctly on the git clone. You can see on the main branch that I uploaded the archives on Friday (26th February). The codes are the same, I did not change a single line in respect for the deadline. I just uploaded it to the master the right way so you can open it on GitHub. Thanks!!

Commands to open:
1) git clone https://github.com/MatheusFidelis/frontend-challenge.git
2) cd frontend-challenge
3) git checkout master
4) open index.html (w/ Live Server or File Explorer)
